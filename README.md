# FileSearch
navigate a file directory

1. Find the Magic Word
2. Find my name
3. Find the cool prime number
4. What is the prize?
5. What is the full filepath to the prize?
6. There is a disguised executable file. What is its name?
7. Once you have found all of the above and answered the questions on Canvas, you should make a copy of all hidden files(not directories) and place them directly in the FileSearch directory with the same filename, but no longer hidden.   When you are in the FileSearch directory and type the ls command (with no additional options) you should see the name of all hidden files.
8.  Once you have made a copy of all hidden files, you should navigate to the FileSearch directory and type the command ls with no options.   take a screenshot of the result (showing all new copies of previously hidden files) and submit that here.
